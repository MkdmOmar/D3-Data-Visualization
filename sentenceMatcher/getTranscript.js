combine business revenue of three sixty five three hundred seventy million\n<1470334109790.58>%HESITATION %HESITATION which remains well I would say on the business side there\'s probably some upside to that number\n<1470334121906.55>given that in the case of next low it we talked about cap revenue for the year upstart dapper Avenue for our year under our ownership limit the height forty\n<1470334150516.81>%HESITATION we get close the deal week to ten days earlier\n<1470334157098.19>then went embedded in that kind so we picked up a little bit of revenue there\n<1470334161289.48>%HESITATION there is a three and a half billion dollar\n<1470334171921.39>the class will pick up about three and half million dollars of additional

know how and where are the businesses\n<1470334400378.07>yeah Tony\'s pick that as well\n<1470334419233.36>between you and our dari competitor %HESITATION we\'re very similar from other services that are offered to the customer and the broader developer community\n<1470334428252.09>%HESITATION hope it will be different and be in here from now I think the biggest that question on the table brand or not\n<1470334454995.39>I\'ve video has and that there are a large sum of VT capital and building their brand awareness in the US market national and unless you know %HESITATION brand here however when\n<1470334473596.08>you punish a combination we believe you can earn a substantial brand awareness\n<1470334489763.68>additionally investing more in terms of building up our developer up awareness and ability community in the US important\n<1470334513400.29>and we get the service level are they better at some things that you are vice a versa but how are the actual service compare\n<1470334520366.38>sure\n<1470334545343.56>so when you look at it from %HESITATION the %HESITATION the component hope what is important for the client\n<1470334624959.41>I don\'t first and

best %HESITATION developer experience out there %HESITATION and we\'re improving on that front %HESITATION going forward however the second part of the %HESITATION the service but a customer\'s look and it is the quality of the communications stuff\n<1470334649507.08>%HESITATION the developer to commission a great %HESITATION when you\'re starting a developer but going forward as you run a service and you\'re a great disservice\n<1470334652309.6>you need to have a substantial global reach\n<1470334670200.32>you could have it sustained quality of communication and this is where out with our network specifically on the international side and our technology\n<1470334677888.96>now we are able to provide a hard body of service upon the\n<1470334679336.75>we don\'t think\n<1470334692918.84>thank you and our next question comes from Dimitri that this with\n<1470334695868.92>William Blair your line is open\n<1470334701231.0>great great quarter

for the second quarter\n<1470334902567.81>and there is no change in our guide other than\n<1470334913314.33>you know the next no the next most piece which was you know two and a mathematical additions plus a bit more of a tail wind\n<1470334916125.22>%HESITATION and we that we thought\n<1470334922246.39>okay pick can you give us a bit of %HESITATION\n<1470334966478.16>on a can you calculate out

you\'re not commenting on that mode jams at this point but\n<1470335036013.13>on the on the right round the clock to the upside\n<1470335082732.7>we need to do anything or that anything is imminent but you know we we look at it now one of Iverson\'s built basis\n<1470335099095.74>and something more or compelling and adjustable arm on the broadcast side you know we we would certainly act on that we also continue locate\n<1470335103871.1>same better border technology in product in hand\n<1470335113399.28>%HESITATION but the main focus continues to be on the broadcast side Imbruglia of fibers
